# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **15 new language extractors (22 → 37 languages)** — closes the language-coverage gap with the Python original. New regex-based extractors: CUDA (`.cu`/`.cuh`, incl. `__global__`/`__device__` kernels), Metal (`.metal`, shader entry points), Svelte (`.svelte`, via `<script>` block extraction), Astro (`.astro`, via frontmatter fence extraction), Groovy (`.groovy`/`.gradle`), SystemVerilog (`.v`/`.sv`/`.svh`), SQL (`.sql`, tables/views/routines), Fortran (`.f`/`.f90`/`.f95`/`.f03`/`.f08`), Pascal/Delphi (`.pas`/`.pp`/`.dpr`/`.dpk`/`.lpr`), Salesforce Apex (`.cls`/`.trigger`, incl. trigger→sObject edges), Terraform/HCL (`.tf`/`.tfvars`/`.hcl`), Bash/Shell (`.sh`/`.bash`), JSON (`.json`, top-level keys), .NET project files (`.sln`/`.csproj`/`.fsproj`/`.vbproj`/`.xaml`/`.razor`/`.cshtml`, package/project references and code-behind links), DM/BYOND (`.dm`/`.dme`/`.dmm`, type paths and procs).
- **Shell-specific call inference** — Bash functions are invoked by bare name, so the shell extractor matches whole-word invocations instead of the `name(` pattern used by other languages.
- **`explain` command** — `graphify-rs explain <node>` prints a node's metadata (ID, file, location), community, degree, and neighbor edges grouped by relation with confidence scores. Resolves by exact ID, exact label, or substring; prefers symbol nodes over file nodes on ties; suggests candidates for unknown names.
- **`--no-viz` build flag** — skips HTML/SVG visualization even when requested via `--format`; outputs JSON and report only. Also settable as `no_viz` in `graphify-rs.toml`.
- **`--cluster-only` build flag** — skips detection and both extraction passes; loads the existing `graph.json` from the output directory, re-runs Leiden clustering and analysis, and re-exports.
- **`--mode deep` build flag** — adds an LLM semantic pass over the largest code files (up to 20), in addition to docs/papers. Deep-mode code results use a separate `<output>/cache/deep/` namespace so they can never be served to the AST pass of a later non-deep build. Also settable as `mode` in `graphify-rs.toml`.
- **Live Neo4j push (`--neo4j-push`)** — pushes the built graph to a running Neo4j instance via the transactional HTTP API (`/db/{db}/tx/commit`), avoiding a Bolt driver dependency. Nodes and edges are `MERGE`d in 500-row `UNWIND` batches (idempotent re-pushes); a `GraphNode.id` uniqueness constraint is created on Neo4j 5+. Credentials come from `[neo4j]` in `graphify-rs.toml` with `NEO4J_URI` / `NEO4J_USER` / `NEO4J_PASSWORD` / `NEO4J_DATABASE` env fallbacks; `bolt://` URIs are normalized to HTTP automatically. Passing `--neo4j-push` bypasses the no-change early-return so the push always runs; push failures are reported without failing the build.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-07-05

### Changed

- **Default output moved back into project directory** — reverts the `~/.graphify-rs/<name>-<hash>/` behavior introduced in 0.6.0. Output now writes to `graphify-rs-out/` inside the directory where the command is run. Explicit `--output` still works as before.
- **Default export formats narrowed to `json, report`** — visual and graph formats (`html`, `svg`, `graphml`, `cypher`, `wiki`, `obsidian`) are now opt-in via `--format`. Reduces default run time and output size for typical use.
- **`--update` flag removed** — replaced by automatic change detection. The build step now checks `changeindex.json` and skips the full rebuild when no file content has changed.
- **Wiki format removed from defaults** — no meaningful use for larger repos; still available via `--format wiki`.

### Added

- **Change index for incremental detection** — new `changeindex.json` (replaces `.graphify_manifest.json`) stores mtime, size, and hash per file. `detect_fast()` uses this to short-circuit rebuilds when nothing changed, without re-hashing unchanged files.
- **Semantic extraction cache-hit fast path** — doc/paper files with a valid cache entry are served immediately; only genuinely new files are sent to the LLM. Progress output shows how many were cached vs. newly processed.
- **Skill guidance: graph tools vs. file search** — new section in `skill.md` with a decision table for when to use `graphify-rs query` vs. Grep/Glob.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **js plugin renamed** — plugin js files renamed from `graphify.js` to `graphify-rs.js` (breaking change)
- **config renamed** — directory-level configuration file renamed from `graphify.toml` to `graphify-rs.toml` (breaking change)
- **MD section markers renamed** — many markers injected into MD files renamed from `graphify` to `graphify-rs` (breaking change)
- **git hook marker renamed** — git hook marker renamed from `graphify-hook-...` to `graphify-rs-hook...` (breaking change)
- **Version staleness check** — warns on startup if installed skill is from an older version
  - `.graphify_version` stamp name — changed to `.graphify_rs_version` (breaking change)
- **default output directory name changed** — from `graphify-out` to `graphify-rs-out` (breaking change)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- **In-memory full-text search index** — `SearchIndex` struct (`graphify-serve::search`) builds an inverted index at graph load time. Tokenizes node labels, IDs, and source file paths on camelCase/snake_case/path boundaries. Supports exact token match + prefix match with degree-based ranking. MCP server builds the index once at startup; `query_graph` and `explore` tools use it for sub-millisecond lookups instead of the previous O(n×m) linear scan.
- **Symbol-level import resolution** — import edges now carry `imported_symbols` in their `extra` field, recording which specific symbols were imported (e.g., `from pathlib import Path` → `["Path"]`). Supported for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, and Java via tree-sitter extraction. The cross-file resolver uses these symbols for precise entity matching (confidence 0.85) before falling back to the all-entities heuristic (0.80).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Edge provenance tracking** — every `GraphEdge` now carries an optional `provenance` field recording where the edge came from (`ast:calls`, `ast:import`, `cross-file:import-resolve`, `cross-file:call-resolve`, `cross-file:python-star-import`, `codegraph-merge`, `llm:semantic`, `regex:*`). Backward-compatible: existing JSON without this field loads as `null`.
- **`explore` MCP tool** — 16th MCP tool. Takes a natural language task, searches for seed nodes, BFS-traverses the subgraph, and returns symbols grouped by file with a relationship map. One call replaces multiple `query_graph` + `get_neighbors` combinations.
- **`affected` test impact analysis** — new `graphify-rs affected` subcommand. Traces reverse dependency edges (`imports`/`uses`/`calls`) from changed files to find affected test files. Supports `--stdin` for piping `git diff --name-only`. Detects 16+ test file naming patterns across 8 languages.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

- **Default output moved to `~/.graphify-rs/<name>-<hash>/`** — no longer writes `graphify-out/` into the project directory. Path is computed from project root's directory name + 8-char hash. Explicit `--output` still works as before.
- **Install hooks use dynamic paths** — CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and hook commands now reference the computed output directory instead of hardcoded `graphify-out/`. Shell paths are properly quoted for spaces.
- **Deduplicated install templates** — merged `claude_md_section`/`agents_md_section` into single `graph_md_section()` function.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **CodeGraph SQLite edge merge** — `graphify-rs build` now auto-detects `.codegraph/codegraph.db` in the project root and merges its edges (calls, imports, contains, etc.) into the knowledge graph. Node kinds are mapped to `NodeType`, file paths normalized, and duplicate edges skipped. Zero-config: works automatically when the DB is present, silently ignored otherwise.

### Changed

- **Skill trigger renamed** — `/graphify` → `/graphify-rs` to match the binary name
- **Unified edge dispatch** — `map_edge_kind()` in `graphify-build` now handles contains/unknown edge kinds through a single match arm instead of ad-hoc fallbacks

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **`serve` auto-build** — `graphify-rs serve` now automatically runs a fast AST-only build if the specified `--graph` file does not exist, making it a zero-config entry point for MCP server setup

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Tree-sitter call-graph extraction** — replace string-matching with AST-based call expression analysis using `collect_callees`/`extract_callee_name`/`extract_name_from_callee`, supporting `identifier`, `attribute` (Python `self.x()`), `field_expression`/`member_expression` (Rust/JS `obj.x()`), `scoped_identifier` (Rust `Module::x()`), `selector_expression` (Go `pkg.Func()`)
- **Cross-file call resolution** — `resolve_cross_file_calls` derives "calls" edges from "uses" edges (import resolution), filtered to Function/Method source nodes only
- **MCP pagination** — `get_community` and `get_neighbors` tools now accept `limit`/`offset` parameters (default 50/0), response includes `total_*`, `returned` metadata
- **Elixir dispatch refactor** — unified 3 duplicate Elixir check blocks into `classify_elixir_call` helper (`ElixirCallKind` enum)

### Fixed

- **Regex call-graph false positives** — `v.get(0)` no longer matches `get()` function; dot-prefixed calls filtered via byte-position check
- **Production `unwrap()` eliminated** — `graphml.rs` (14 `.unwrap()` → `?`), `cypher.rs` (`ids.pop().unwrap()` → `if let Some`)
- **`resolve_cross_file_calls` scope** — changed from `pub fn` to `fn`; added Function/Method filter to prevent Struct→Struct "calls" edges

### Changed

- Split `html.rs` template functions into `html_templates.rs`
- MCP response field renames: `neighbor_count` → `total_neighbors`, `member_count` → `total_members`

## [0.5.0] - 2025-05-15

### Breaking Changes

- Tree-sitter handler functions now take `WalkContext` struct instead of 11 individual parameters

### Fixed

- `days_since_epoch_2020` off-by-one: `2020-01-01` now returns 0 instead of 1
- `detect_incremental` eliminated double I/O — hashes computed during directory walk
- `build_unique_var_names`/`build_unique_filenames` use `Vec::pop()` for deterministic single-element extraction
- Cypher export uses `is_ascii_alphanumeric()` for Neo4j compatibility (CJK chars no longer break syntax)
- `detect_incremental` binary files (images) now correctly compared against cached hashes
- `resolve_cross_file_imports` fallback edges capped per import (MAX_FALLBACK_EDGES = 50)
- Iterative Tarjan's SCC and DFS cycle detection (no stack overflow on large graphs)
- `looks_like_paper` reads only first N bytes instead of entire file
- Sensitive detection uses word-boundary matching (no false positives like "tokenizer.rs")
- `make_id` preserves CJK characters with `is_alphanumeric()`
- `cypher_escape` handles newlines (`\n`, `\r`)
- Semantic extraction shows truncation notice for large files
- `date_to_age` uses cumulative days table instead of 30-day/month approximation
- Cache layer cleans up `.tmp` files on failed atomic rename
- Eliminated production `unwrap()` / `panic!()` calls
- `handle_shortest_path` removed unreachable None branch
- `handle_get_neighbors` replaced `Vec` allocation with `count()` for edge counting

### Changed

- Split `ast_extract.rs` (1329 lines) into `mod.rs` + 10 language submodules
- Split `treesitter/mod.rs` (1299 lines) into `mod.rs` + `handlers.rs` + `imports.rs`
- Split `mcp.rs` (1309 lines) into `mod.rs` + `handlers.rs` + `tools.rs`
- Introduced `WalkContext` struct to eliminate `too_many_arguments` clippy warnings
- Removed redundant comments and decorative separators

## [0.4.5] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **OpenCode integration** — some OpenCode issues fixed:
  - `install.rs`: fixed `opencode.json` incorrect config node name (was `pluigns`, must be `plugin`)

## [0.4.4] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Clippy warnings resolved** — 6 warnings across 4 files fixed:
  - `treesitter.rs`: Merged identical `get`/`set` prefix stripping branches
  - `lib.rs`: Collapsed nested `if` into let-chain for Rust 2024
  - `embedding.rs`: Replaced loop variable indexing with slice iterator
  - `temporal.rs`: Removed needless borrow in `date_to_age()` call

## [0.4.3] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Dart extraction — Critical fixes for 70-80% missing edges**
  - `treesitter.rs`: Added missing `function_declaration` and `method_definition` types (fixes 40-60% of functions)
  - `treesitter.rs`: Added `part_directive` and `part_of_directive` for Dart file-splitting (fixes cross-file relationships)
  - `lib.rs`: Rewrote `resolve_dart_import()` to handle aliased imports (`as`), deferred imports, relative paths (`../`), and part directives (fixes 30-50% of imports)
  - `treesitter.rs`: Added function name normalization for Dart getters/setters (strips `get`/`set` prefixes)
- **Ruby import handler** — `require`/`require_relative` now produce clean module names instead of raw AST text; non-require `call` nodes no longer intercepted as imports
- **Python star import** — `from x import *` now correctly detected even when prior import statements exist (was counting total edges instead of per-statement delta)
- **Java static import** — `import static java.util.Arrays.asList` no longer mis-parsed due to nested `unwrap_or_else` confusion
- **Dart function signatures** — `function_signature`/`method_signature` nodes without `name` field now fall back to first `identifier` child
- **JS async functions** — added `async_function_declaration` to tree-sitter config (was only covered by regex fallback)
- **Ruby no-parens call inference** — call-graph heuristic now detects Ruby-style `bark` calls without parentheses via word-boundary matching
- **NodeType classification for all languages** — `classify_class_kind()` now returns correct types for C/C++/C#/Java/Dart/Ruby (struct→Struct, enum→Enum, interface→Interface, namespace→Namespace, module→Module); was previously falling through to Class for all non-Rust types
- **Dart import handler** — dedicated `extract_dart_import()` properly strips `deferred as`/`show`/`hide` suffixes from import paths

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Skill file sync** — installed skill at `~/.claude/skills/` now matches repo (was stuck at 7 tools, updated to 15)
- **`--max-viz-nodes` flag** added to skill.md available flags

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **SECURITY.md** — responsible vulnerability disclosure process
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — detailed 14-crate design, algorithm table, MCP tool reference, dependency graph
- **Examples** — `examples/build_and_query.rs` (full pipeline) + `examples/custom_graph.rs` (programmatic API)
- **Criterion benchmarks** — `benches/graphify_bench.rs` with 6 benchmarks (clustering, PageRank, cycles, export, extraction)
- **CI/downloads/docs.rs badges** — README now shows build status, crate downloads, and docs link

### Changed
- **README redesigned** — centered header, streamlined sections, Quick Start with `--no-llm` first, performance table, slim architecture overview with links to detailed docs
- **CONTRIBUTING.md expanded** — architecture overview, test expectations, PR checklist, release process
- **CLI docs with TOC** — both CLI.md and CLI_CN.md now have table of contents for navigation

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **8 new MCP tools** — `find_all_paths`, `weighted_path`, `community_bridges`, `graph_diff`, `pagerank`, `detect_cycles`, `smart_summary`, `find_similar`. Total MCP tools: 7 → 15
- **PageRank algorithm** — power iteration with configurable damping (0.85) and convergence detection; identifies structurally critical nodes beyond simple degree ranking
- **Dependency cycle detection** — Tarjan's SCC algorithm finds circular dependencies (imports/uses/calls); severity scored by cycle length
- **Smart graph summarization** — three abstraction levels for LLM token budgets: `Detailed` (full graph), `Community` (one representative per community + cross-community edges), `Architecture` (directory-level super-nodes with aggregated dependencies)
- **Graph embedding + similarity** — Node2Vec random walks + Skip-gram SGD learns 64-dim node embeddings; cosine similarity finds structurally similar node pairs (redundancy/refactoring candidates)
- **Temporal risk analysis** — git blame integration correlates change frequency × connectivity to identify high-risk nodes (`temporal.rs`)
- **Incremental community detection** — `cluster_incremental()` re-clusters only affected communities when files change; falls back to full Leiden when >50% communities affected
- **Weighted graph analysis** — `confidence_to_weight()` maps EXTRACTED→1.0, INFERRED→0.7, AMBIGUOUS→0.3; `BridgeNode` model for bridge analysis
- **Cross-file import resolution for all 21 languages** — was only Python/JS/Rust/Go; now includes Java, C#, C/C++, Kotlin, PHP, Dart, Scala, Swift (language-specific resolvers for dot imports, backslash imports, C includes, Dart packages)
- **378 tests** covering all 21 supported languages, organized in `tests/` directory per Rust conventions
- **`--max-viz-nodes` flag** — configurable HTML visualization node limit (default 2000), allows larger projects to show more context

### Changed
- **Leiden clustering 10-50x faster** — pre-computed `sigma_c` and `ki_cache` with incremental updates; single-pass neighbor aggregation replaces per-community scans; `merge_small_communities()` uses incremental `node_to_cid`
- **Cross-file import resolution ~100x faster** — `id_to_label` HashMap O(1) lookup replaces O(n) linear scan per import edge; index building consolidated from 6 passes to 2
- **JSON export streaming** — `write_node_link_json()` writes directly to `BufWriter<File>` via `serde_json::Serializer`, eliminating ~500 MB intermediate `Value` + `String` for large graphs
- **Parallel file extraction** — `rayon::par_iter` for concurrent AST extraction and cache lookups; ~6x speedup on 8-core machines

### Fixed
- **God Nodes community column showing "–"** — `cluster()` never wrote back to `node.community`; added `get_node_mut()` and post-clustering community assignment
- **God Nodes duplicate "lib" labels** — multiple crates with `lib.rs` all showed "lib"; added `disambiguate_label()` to prefix with crate name (e.g., `graphify-export::lib`)
- **Semaphore unwrap panic** — `sem.acquire().await.unwrap()` replaced with proper error propagation via `map_err()`

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **File name too long (os error 63)** — Obsidian/Wiki export used node labels/IDs as filenames without length limit, causing crashes on macOS (255-byte limit) when analyzing Dart or other languages with long identifiers. Added `truncate_to_bytes()` utility (240-byte cap) to `graphify-core`, applied in `obsidian.rs` and `wiki.rs`

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Dart language support** — tree-sitter grammar + AST extraction (21 languages total)
- **Skill file** (`skill.md`) — comprehensive AI agent guide with all commands, rebuild rules, and MCP setup
- **Version staleness check** — warns on startup if installed skill is from an older version
- **`.graphify_version` stamp** — written during `graphify-rs install` for staleness detection
- **Small community merging** — communities with < 5 nodes automatically merged into most-connected neighbor
- **Smart community labeling** — picks descriptive function/struct names instead of generic "lib"
- **Graph rebuild instructions** — skill and CLAUDE.md now instruct agents to rebuild after code changes

### Changed
- **tree-sitter upgraded** — core `0.24` → `0.26.8`, grammars to latest (python 0.25, go 0.25, rust 0.24, etc.)
- **Leiden resolution parameter** — lowered from 1.0 to 0.3, reducing over-fragmentation (140 → ~64 communities on same codebase)
- **Command name consistency** — all user-facing strings now use `graphify-rs` instead of `graphify` (git hooks, skill, install messages, hook JSON, OpenCode plugin, report footer, benchmark banner)
- **Claude Code hook format** — aligned with Python original: `hookEventName` + `additionalContext` instead of `prefix`
- **Codex hooks.json format** — aligned with Python original: `PreToolUse` array + `systemMessage`
- **CLAUDE.md rebuild rule** — full command `graphify-rs build --path . --output graphify-out --no-llm --update`

### Fixed
- **God Nodes degree=0** — report showed degree 0 for all god nodes due to JSON field name mismatch (`"edges"` → `"degree"`)
- **God Nodes missing community** — `"community"` field was not included in JSON passed to report generator
- **Clippy warnings** — fixed 25 `collapsible_if` + 1 `let_and_return` across 14 files using Rust 2024 let-chains

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Split HTML export** — `export_html_split()` generates per-community HTML pages with overview navigation
- **Auto-pruning for large graphs** — HTML viz auto-prunes to top-degree + community representative nodes for graphs > 2000 nodes
- **Barnes-Hut physics** — enabled for graphs > 500 nodes, disabled after stabilization
- **Debounced search** — HTML search input debounced 200ms + batch `nodes.update()` to prevent UI lag
- **Shell completions** — `graphify-rs completions bash/zsh/fish` via clap_complete

- **`graphify-rs stats`** — show graph statistics without rebuilding
- **`graphify-rs diff`** — compare two graph snapshots
- **`graphify-rs init`** — create graphify.toml config file
- **Error recovery** — `catch_unwind` for extraction, continues on individual file failures
- **Parallel semantic extraction** — tokio::sync::Semaphore for concurrent Claude API calls
- **Watch incremental rebuild** — only re-extracts changed files via cache invalidation
- **Progress bars** — indicatif progress bars for file extraction
- **Colored output** — colored terminal output via `colored` crate
- **Open source community files** — CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md

### Changed
- **Leiden algorithm** — replaced Louvain with Leiden (refinement phase ensures internally connected communities)
- **Rust Edition 2024** — migrated from 2021, using implicit borrowing patterns
- **Multi-platform install** — Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Claw, Droid, Trae, Trae-CN support

### Fixed
- **UTF-8 truncation panic** — `&content[..N]` panics on Chinese/CJK text; fixed with `is_char_boundary()` backward search
- **HTML visualization crash on large graphs** — out-of-memory on > 2000 nodes; fixed with auto-pruning
- **Search performance** — `nodes.update()` called per-node on every keystroke; fixed with debounce + batch update
